# ProjectWeek1-Team-Iota

## PREMISE
* The US has been a leader in wealth, health, and education since the industrial revolution
* But in the last couple of decades, the rest of the world has been catching up (internet, post war rebuilding)
* We are curious if there is data out there that might be able to give us an idea of which countries are catching up the most, and if the US is declining in terms of it's place in the world 
* In other words, Is the US at risk of being dethroned? When will this happen? Who will be the most probable country to take the lead?


## GOALS / DELIVERABLES
1. Find out what metrics to use to categorize how the US has been doing in the past 40 years
	* What are the metrics that categorize a country to be a world leader or developing nation
	* Which metrics showing Wealth (GDP), Health, and Literacy should we focus on?
2. Analyze the data and make graphs
	* See how the US has been doing in these areas and graph it
	* Is it increasing? Decreasing? Which parts are increasing/decreasing?
3. Find out which other countries are doing well around the world (3 from each continent)
4. Compare this to the US and see if others are doing better


## TYPES OF DATA TO USE
* **Wealth** -- GDP -- Poverty
	* GDP Per Capita
	* Mean GDP vs. Median GDP
		* Mean going up, but median is not
	* Debt to GDP Ratio - IMF has this

* **Health** -- Lifespan -- Infant Mortality
	* Life expectancy
	* Infant mortality rate
	* Mortality rate under 5 yo

* **Education / Literacy** - Each country has a published literacy rate
	* Aggregate Literacy rate measure
	* Government expenditure on education
	* Secondary school enrollment as a % of school age population

* **Happiness - Nice to have - vague - possibly a good footnote idea**
	* Taxes
	* Social Wealth
	* Basic needs
	* Quality of life

## LIST OF POSSIBLE QUESTIONS
* How has that changed over the past 50 years (1970)?
* Have we reached an apex?
* Where are we going from here?
* What are the factors influencing this?
* Is the US becoming less of a world leader
