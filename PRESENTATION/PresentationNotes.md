	Animation of US GDP running away from other countries

2. 1 bar USGDP per capita by itself, populate the others, then turn to stacked bar graph (what percentage they spend on healthcare and education) (china, US, europe)

Bubble chart could show time vs. education metric 1 (bubble size per capita GDP, color = country)


6. COMBINE IT ALL TOGETHER
Overall idea of Wealth, Health, and Education
